# REDengine

I am intrigued by the moddability of REDengine, but honestly ...
if I don't put a lot of content here, there are reasons.

Reason No.1 : Compared to the BSG Creation Engine, REDengine can just barely be called moddable.

Reason No.2 : While enjoy both games to some extent, I am a hardcore fan of neither. I have some opinions ...

- Cyberpunk : I am a fan of Blade Runner. I am familiar with the Cyberpunk RPG. And yet, CP2077 falls flat -- characters, plot, and environment.
- Witcher :  CDPR did a much better job with the IP than Sapkowski. But I read Sapkowski and now I can't unread it.
