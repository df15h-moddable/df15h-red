# REDengine

I am intrigued by the moddability of REDengine, however ...
if I don't put a lot of content here, there are reasons.

- No.1 : Compared to the BSG Creation Engine, REDengine can just barely be called moddable.
- No.2 : While I enjoy both games to some extent, I am a hardcore fan of neither. I have some opinions ....
- No.2A : CDPR did a much better job with the Witcher than Sapkowski. But I read Sapkowski and now I can't unread it. (At best, it's Warhammer fan-fic. I don't buy the "lost in translation" argument, since its problems aren't all idiomatic.)
- No.2B : I am familiar with the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG. I am a fan of Blade Runner. And yet, CP2077 falls flat -- especially with respect to characters and environment. (Yes, even after the DLCs.)
